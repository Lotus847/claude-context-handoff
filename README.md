# claude-context-handoff

**A Claude Code session that notices when its own context window is filling, writes a high-fidelity handoff, and opens a fresh session to continue — automatically.**

Long Claude Code sessions degrade: the context window fills, early turns get compacted away, and the model starts re-reading files and losing the thread. The problem is that **a session can't see its own context usage** — there's no built-in signal telling the model "you're getting full."

This fixes that with two sensors and one action:

- **A gauge hook** (the model's eyes) reads the real per-turn token usage Claude Code records in the transcript, and when you cross a threshold it injects a `[context-handoff]` nudge the model reads.
- **A statusline** (your eyes) shows live `🧠 ctx 63% (126k/200k)`, green → yellow → red.
- **A `/handoff` skill** (the hands) that — on the nudge, or when you type `/handoff` — writes a full-fidelity `HANDOFF.md` (authored while the session still holds the full context), then **opens a new, named terminal session seeded to continue**, and offers to close the old one.

## Install

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18+ and [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lotus847/claude-context-handoff
cd claude-context-handoff
node install.js
```

That copies the runtime to `~/.claude/context-handoff`, installs the `/handoff` skill, and merges the gauge hook + statusline into `~/.claude/settings.json` (it backs up first, preserves your existing hooks, and is safe to re-run). Claude Code re-reads hooks/statusline/skills **live**, so it's active in open chats on their next prompt — no restart needed.

Remove with `node uninstall.js`.

## Usage

- **Automatic:** as context fills, the statusline turns yellow then red, and the model gets a `[context-handoff]` nudge to finish its step and hand off.
- **Manual:** type `/handoff` anytime.

Either way, `/handoff`:
1. reads the current context %,
2. refreshes whatever durable memory you have (native auto-memory / `CLAUDE.md` / your notes — skipped if you have none),
3. writes `~/.claude/context-handoff/handoffs/<project>/HANDOFF.md` with a ready-to-paste cold-start,
4. opens a **new tab** in your current Windows Terminal window, named for tracking and seeded to read the handoff and continue **in auto mode**,
5. asks whether to close the old session.

## Configuration

Edit `~/.claude/context-handoff/config.json` (re-read live):

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `notifyPct` | `0.70` | First "drifting past optimal" nudge at this fraction of the window |
| `urgentPct` | `0.88` | "Act now" nudge — auto-compaction is near |
| `softCapTokens` | `null` | Optional absolute early-notify floor (e.g. `300000` on a 1M-context model) |
| `contextLimitTokens` | `null` | Pin your window size (e.g. `1000000`); `null` = auto-detect |
| `newSessionFlags` | `"--permission-mode auto"` | Flags for the launched session. `""` for none; `"--dangerously-skip-permissions"` for fully hands-free (disables **all** gates) |
| `newSessionMode` | `"tab"` | `"tab"` = new tab in current Windows Terminal window; `"window"` = separate window |
| `trustNewSessionFolder` | `false` | Pre-accept the folder's trust dialog (see Security) |

## Platform support

| Feature | Windows | macOS / Linux |
|---------|:-------:|:-------------:|
| Gauge hook + statusline + `/handoff` doc | ✅ | ✅ |
| Auto-**launch** a new session | ✅ (Windows Terminal / `start`) | ⏳ prints the exact command to run manually |
| Auto-**close** the old session | ✅ | ⏳ close manually |

macOS/Linux auto-launch/close aren't implemented yet — the seam is `src/lib/platform.js`. **PRs welcome.**

## Security notes

- Launched sessions default to `--permission-mode auto` (auto-approves safe actions, still gates risky ones) — **not** a full bypass.
- `trustNewSessionFolder` is **off by default**. Turning it on makes the launcher set `hasTrustDialogAccepted=true` for the launched folder in `~/.claude.json`, skipping Claude Code's workspace-trust dialog. That's a convenience that disables a safety gate — only enable it if you understand the trade-off.
- Closing the old session is a **force-terminate** of that session's process, so Claude Code's own `Stop`/`SessionEnd` hooks may not run. If you rely on those, close the tab manually.

## How it works

Claude Code writes each assistant turn's token `usage` into the session transcript, and hands the statusline a `context_window` object — both give the true context size. The gauge reads it, compares against the resolved window limit, and nudges once per threshold crossing (re-arming after a compaction drops the window). The `/handoff` skill is the high-fidelity, *active* complement to passive auto-summaries: it's authored by the session that still holds the full context.
